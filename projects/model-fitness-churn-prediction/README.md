# Model Fitness – Churn Prediction & Segmentation (2025)

**Problem.** Rising churn; need early-risk signals and targeted actions.

**Data/ETL.** User activity, subscription status. Clean, feature engineering (recency/frequency/tenure), train/test split.

**Analysis.** **Logistic Regression** & **Random Forest**; evaluate ROC-AUC, precision/recall, F1.

**Results.** Retention playbook with **up to −15% churn potential** (win-back & education nudges).

**Stack.** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

**Next steps.** Calibrate probabilities, SHAP for interpretability, pilot targeted outreach.
