# E-commerce – A/B Testing & Growth Prioritization (2025)

**Problem.** Too many growth ideas; need prioritized experiments.

**Data/ETL.** Daily visits, orders, ticket. Clean & join; define primary metrics (CR, ARPU/ARPPU).

**Analysis.** Prioritize with **ICE/RICE**; design **A/B tests**; evaluate with **t-test/chi-square** (SciPy).

**Results.** Highest-ROI hypothesis → projected **+8% sales uplift**; experiment plan & decision criteria.

**Stack.** Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy).

**Next steps.** Instrumentation audit; sequential testing or CUPED for variance reduction.
