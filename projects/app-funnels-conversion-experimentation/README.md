# App Funnels – Conversion & Experimentation (2025)

**Problem.** Measure the home→payment funnel; assess a UI change.

**Data/ETL.** Event logs; validate duplicates/missing; define funnel steps.

**Analysis.** Build funnels, split **control vs test**, run **t-tests/chi-square**; document instrumentation gaps.

**Results.** No significant lift; proposed event fixes and next-test design (power, duration, metrics).

**Stack.** Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy).

**Next steps.** Implement analytics taxonomy, run follow-up experiment with improved tracking.
